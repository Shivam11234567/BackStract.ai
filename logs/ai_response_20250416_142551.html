<div class='reasoning-output'><strong>Reasoning:</strong><pre><code>This database design aims to support a social interaction application specifically for international students. Think of it like building with digital Lego blocks. Each block (or &#x27;table&#x27;) holds a specific type of information. 

1.  **users**: This is the foundation, holding the basic login information (email, password) for everyone using the app. Each user gets a unique ID number.
2.  **profiles**: Since users need more than just login info, this table stores details like their name, where they&#x27;re from, where they are studying now, their university, and maybe a short bio or profile picture. It&#x27;s linked directly to a user, like a detailed name tag.
3.  **posts**: This is where users share things ‚Äì thoughts, questions, experiences. Each post is linked back to the user who wrote it.
4.  **comments**: People can reply to posts, and these replies are stored here. Each comment is linked to the post it&#x27;s replying to and the user who wrote the comment. We also allow comments on comments (threading) by linking a comment back to its &#x27;parent&#x27; comment.
5.  **events**: International students might want to organize or find meetups, study sessions, or cultural events. This table stores event details like title, description, time, and location, and who created it.
6.  **event_attendees**: Since many users can attend one event, and one user can attend many events, we need a &#x27;connector&#x27; table. This table simply lists which user is attending which event.
7.  **groups**: Users can form clubs or groups based on shared interests, nationality, or university. This table holds the group&#x27;s name, description, and who created it.
8.  **group_members**: Similar to events, many users can join a group, and a user can be in multiple groups. This &#x27;connector&#x27; table tracks who is a member of which group and their role (like admin or regular member).
9.  **messages**: For private chats between two users, this table stores the message content, who sent it, who received it, and when.
10. **friendships**: To manage connections between users (like friend requests), this table tracks who requested the connection, who received the request, and the status (like &#x27;pending&#x27; or &#x27;accepted&#x27;).

These tables and their connections allow the app to store and retrieve all the necessary information for students to connect, share, organize events, form groups, and communicate.</code></pre></div>
