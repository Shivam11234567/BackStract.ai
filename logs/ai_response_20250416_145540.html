<div class='reasoning-output'><strong>Reasoning:</strong><pre><code>This database structure is designed for a school management application. We start with the core people involved: &#x27;students&#x27;, &#x27;teachers&#x27;, and &#x27;parents&#x27;. The &#x27;parents&#x27; table stores guardian information, linked one-to-many to &#x27;students&#x27; (one parent can have multiple students, but we link each student to one primary contact for simplicity here, though this could be expanded). The &#x27;students&#x27; table holds student details. The &#x27;teachers&#x27; table holds educator information.

Next, we define what is taught: &#x27;courses&#x27; represent the subjects (like &#x27;Math&#x27;, &#x27;History&#x27;). Specific offerings of these courses taught by a particular teacher in a given year/term are represented by &#x27;classes&#x27; (e.g., &#x27;Grade 9 Math - Section A&#x27;). Each &#x27;class&#x27; is linked to one &#x27;course&#x27; and one &#x27;teacher&#x27;.

To connect students to classes, we use the &#x27;enrollments&#x27; table. This is a &#x27;junction&#x27; table, handling the many-to-many relationship (a student can enroll in many classes, and a class has many students). It also stores the final grade for the student in that class.

Within a class, teachers give out &#x27;assignments&#x27;. Each assignment belongs to a specific &#x27;class&#x27;. When students submit their work, it&#x27;s recorded in the &#x27;submissions&#x27; table, linking the &#x27;student&#x27; to the &#x27;assignment&#x27;. This table also stores the submission details, the date, and the specific grade/feedback for that piece of work.

Finally, to track daily presence, the &#x27;attendance&#x27; table records whether a &#x27;student&#x27; was present, absent, etc., for a specific &#x27;class&#x27; on a particular &#x27;attendance_date&#x27;. This structure allows the school to manage its core entities, their relationships, academic activities, and attendance efficiently.</code></pre></div>
