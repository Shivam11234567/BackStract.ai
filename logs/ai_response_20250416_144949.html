<div class='reasoning-output'><strong>Reasoning:</strong><pre><code>This database design aims to capture the essential elements of a school management system in a structured way, making it easy to understand even without technical knowledge. We start with the core people involved: &#x27;students&#x27;, &#x27;parents&#x27;, and &#x27;teachers&#x27;, each stored in their own table with basic contact information. Think of these like digital filing cabinets for each group. We link students to their parents using a &#x27;parent_id&#x27; in the &#x27;students&#x27; table, showing who is responsible for each student. Then, we have &#x27;courses&#x27;, which are the subjects offered (like &#x27;Math&#x27;, &#x27;Science&#x27;). A &#x27;class&#x27; represents a specific offering of a course, taught by a particular teacher in a specific year or term (like &#x27;Math 101 - Mr. Smith - Fall 2024&#x27;). We link &#x27;classes&#x27; to both &#x27;courses&#x27; and &#x27;teachers&#x27; to show what subject is being taught and by whom. To track which students are taking which classes, we use an &#x27;enrollments&#x27; table; this acts like a sign-up sheet, connecting a student to a class. For managing schoolwork, the &#x27;assignments&#x27; table lists tasks given out in each class, linked back to the specific &#x27;class&#x27;. When a student hands in work, we record it in the &#x27;submissions&#x27; table, linking it to both the &#x27;student&#x27; and the specific &#x27;assignment&#x27;, and including the grade and any feedback directly in this record. Finally, the &#x27;attendance&#x27; table keeps track of whether students were present or absent for each class on specific dates, linking &#x27;students&#x27; and &#x27;classes&#x27; to a date and attendance status. This structure separates different types of information logically, making it easier to manage and retrieve specific details about students, classes, grades, and attendance.</code></pre></div>
