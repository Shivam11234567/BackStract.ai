<div class='reasoning-output'><strong>Reasoning:</strong><pre><code>This database design helps international students connect. Think of it like organizing information in different folders. The &#x27;users&#x27; folder holds basic login info for each student. The &#x27;profiles&#x27; folder keeps extra details like nationality and university, linked to each user. &#x27;communities&#x27; are like clubs or groups students can create or join (e.g., &#x27;Indian Students at XYZ University&#x27;). To know who is in which community, we use the &#x27;community_members&#x27; folder, linking users and communities. Students share updates or questions in &#x27;posts&#x27;, which can belong to a specific community or be general. Others can reply using &#x27;comments&#x27;. Communities can organize &#x27;events&#x27; (like meetups or study sessions), and &#x27;event_attendees&#x27; tracks who&#x27;s going. For private chats, &#x27;messages&#x27; store conversations between two users. Finally, &#x27;friendships&#x27; keeps track of direct connections students make with each other. Each folder (table) has specific pieces of information (columns), and unique IDs help link related information across different folders, making it easy for the app to find and display everything correctly.</code></pre></div>
