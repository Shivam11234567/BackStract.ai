<div class='reasoning-output'><strong>Reasoning:</strong><pre><code>This database design helps international students connect. Think of it like organizing information in different folders. The &#x27;users&#x27; folder holds basic login info for each student. The &#x27;profiles&#x27; folder keeps extra details like nationality or university, linked directly to a specific user. &#x27;communities&#x27; are like specific club folders (e.g., &#x27;Students from India&#x27;, &#x27;University XYZ Club&#x27;). Since a student can join many clubs and a club has many students, we need a &#x27;community_members&#x27; list to track who is in which club. &#x27;posts&#x27; are like announcements or messages students share, either generally or within a specific community folder. &#x27;comments&#x27; are replies attached to these posts, noting who replied and to which post. &#x27;events&#x27; are planned activities within a community, like a welcome party, noting who created it and for which community. &#x27;event_attendees&#x27; is a sign-up sheet showing which students are going to which event. &#x27;messages&#x27; are like private notes passed between two specific students. Finally, &#x27;friendships&#x27; keeps track of which students have connected as friends, like a buddy list, noting who requested the friendship and if it was accepted.</code></pre></div>
