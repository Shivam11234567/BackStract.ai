<div class='reasoning-output'><strong>Reasoning:</strong><pre><code>This database design aims to support a social application for international students. We start with a &#x27;users&#x27; table to store basic login information for each student. To keep the user table clean and store more detailed, optional information, we have a separate &#x27;profiles&#x27; table linked one-to-one with &#x27;users&#x27;. This holds details like nationality, university, and bio. The core of the interaction happens in &#x27;communities&#x27;, which represent groups students can join (based on nationality, university, etc.). Since a student can join multiple communities and a community has multiple members, we need a &#x27;community_members&#x27; table to link &#x27;users&#x27; and &#x27;communities&#x27; (a many-to-many relationship). Students share content via &#x27;posts&#x27;. A post is created by a user and can optionally belong to a specific community. Users can interact with posts by adding &#x27;comments&#x27;. Both posts and comments are linked back to the user who created them. To facilitate real-world interaction, we have an &#x27;events&#x27; table. Events can be created by users, potentially associated with a community, and have details like time and location. Similar to communities, many users can attend many events, so an &#x27;event_attendees&#x27; table links &#x27;users&#x27; and &#x27;events&#x27;. For direct interaction, a &#x27;messages&#x27; table allows one-on-one conversations between users, storing sender, receiver, and content. Finally, a &#x27;friendships&#x27; table manages connections between users, tracking the status of the friendship (like pending or accepted), again linking two users together.</code></pre></div>
