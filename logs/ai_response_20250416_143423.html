<div class='reasoning-output'><strong>Reasoning:</strong><pre><code>This database structure is designed to help international students connect and interact. Think of it like organizing information into different labeled boxes (tables). The &#x27;users&#x27; box holds the basic login details for each student. The &#x27;profiles&#x27; box stores extra info about them, like their name, where they&#x27;re from, their university, and interests, linked directly to their user account. Students can share updates or ask questions using &#x27;posts&#x27;, and others can reply with &#x27;comments&#x27;. To organize get-togethers, there&#x27;s an &#x27;events&#x27; box, listing details like what, when, and where. We need a way to know who&#x27;s going to which event, so the &#x27;event_attendees&#x27; box connects students (&#x27;users&#x27;) to events. Similarly, students can form clubs or groups based on shared interests (like nationality or major) using the &#x27;groups&#x27; box. The &#x27;group_members&#x27; box keeps track of who belongs to which group. For private chats, the &#x27;messages&#x27; box stores conversations between two students. Finally, the &#x27;friendships&#x27; box manages friend requests and connections between students, noting who is friends with whom. Each box has unique IDs to identify items (like a specific user or post) and uses linked IDs (foreign keys) to show how information in different boxes relates, like linking a post back to the student who wrote it.</code></pre></div>
