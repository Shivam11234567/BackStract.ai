<div class='reasoning-output'><strong>Reasoning:</strong><pre><code>This database design aims to support a global student collaboration network. We start with &#x27;students&#x27; as the core users, storing their basic login information. Each student can have a &#x27;profile&#x27; with more detailed information like their university and major, linked one-to-one with the student. Collaboration happens primarily within &#x27;projects&#x27; or &#x27;groups&#x27;. A &#x27;projects&#x27; table stores information about specific collaborative efforts, while a &#x27;groups&#x27; table allows students to form communities based on interests or courses. Since a student can join multiple projects/groups, and each project/group can have many students, we use &#x27;junction&#x27; tables: &#x27;project_members&#x27; connects students and projects, and &#x27;group_members&#x27; connects students and groups, defining their roles within each. Projects can be broken down into smaller &#x27;tasks&#x27;, stored in their own table and linked back to the parent project. Similar to projects/groups, a task might involve multiple students, and a student might be assigned several tasks, so a &#x27;task_assignments&#x27; table links students and tasks. Communication within these collaborations is handled by &#x27;posts&#x27;, which can be linked either to a specific project or a group, allowing discussions relevant to that context. Finally, students need to share materials, so a &#x27;resources&#x27; table stores information about uploaded files or links, which can also be associated with either projects or groups, and tracks who uploaded them. This structure provides distinct areas for user information, collaboration spaces (projects/groups), task management, communication, and resource sharing, all interconnected to facilitate student interaction.</code></pre></div>
