<div class='reasoning-output'><strong>Reasoning:</strong><pre><code>This database structure is designed to help international students connect within their communities. We start with a &#x27;users&#x27; table, which is like a digital ID card holding basic login information (email, password) for each student. Since students have more details to share, we link each user to a &#x27;profiles&#x27; table, storing things like their name, nationality, university, and a short bio ‚Äì think of it as their personal introduction page. Students interact within &#x27;communities&#x27; (like clubs based on nationality or university), so we have a table for these groups, noting who created them. To track who belongs to which community, a &#x27;community_members&#x27; table connects users and communities, like a membership list. Students share updates or questions as &#x27;posts&#x27;, which can belong to a specific community or be general. Others can reply with &#x27;comments&#x27; on these posts. The application also supports organizing get-togethers using an &#x27;events&#x27; table, specifying details like time and place, potentially linked to a community. An &#x27;event_attendees&#x27; table keeps track of who plans to go to which event. For private chats, a &#x27;messages&#x27; table stores conversations between two users. Finally, a &#x27;friendships&#x27; table allows students to formally connect with each other, like adding friends on social media. Each table has a unique ID for its records (like a serial number), and connections between tables are made using these IDs (foreign keys) to show how information relates, for example, which user wrote which post or belongs to which community.</code></pre></div>
