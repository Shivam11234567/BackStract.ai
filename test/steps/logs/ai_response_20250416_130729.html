<div class='reasoning-output'><strong>Reasoning:</strong><pre><code>This database design aims to support an application for international students. We start with a &#x27;users&#x27; table for basic login information (email, password). To store more details about each student like their name, nationality, university, and interests, we use a separate &#x27;profiles&#x27; table linked to &#x27;users&#x27;. This keeps the user login data separate from their descriptive information. Since the goal is social interaction within communities, a &#x27;communities&#x27; table is essential to define groups (based on nationality, university, etc.). A user creates a community. To manage the relationship where one student can join multiple communities and one community has many students, we need a &#x27;community_members&#x27; junction table. This table links users to the communities they&#x27;ve joined. Social interaction involves sharing content, so a &#x27;posts&#x27; table stores messages or updates created by users. Posts can optionally belong to a specific community. To allow discussions, a &#x27;comments&#x27; table holds replies, linking back to the post and the commenting user. It also supports nested replies. International students often participate in events, so an &#x27;events&#x27; table stores information about meetups, study sessions, etc., including details like time and location. Events can be created by users and may be linked to a community. Similar to community membership, tracking event attendance (many users attend many events) requires an &#x27;event_attendees&#x27; junction table linking users to the events they register for. Finally, to allow students to connect directly, a &#x27;friendships&#x27; table manages friend requests and connections between pairs of users. This structure separates different types of information logically, uses junction tables for many-to-many relationships, and provides the core features needed for a community-focused social application for international students.</code></pre></div>
